// Package timer is a kitchen timer: Home Assistant keeps the timers, the device counts them down on
// the ring and rings when one finishes.
//
// Home Assistant sends an event when a timer starts, is changed, is canceled or finishes, and
// nothing in between — so the countdown here is local arithmetic against a monotonic clock, corrected
// whenever an event arrives. A finished timer is dropped at that end, so the ringing is entirely this
// device's to start and to stop.
